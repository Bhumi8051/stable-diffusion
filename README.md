#Stable Diffusion 2.1 Image Generation
This project implements an image generation feature using the Stable Diffusion 2.1 model from Hugging Face. The application takes a textual prompt from the user and generates corresponding images through a REST API.

Overview
The Stable Diffusion 2.1 model is a powerful image generation model that can create high-quality images based on textual descriptions. By integrating this model with a REST API, we provide a seamless interface for users to generate images on demand.

Features
Text-to-Image Generation: Users can input a textual description, and the model generates an image that matches the description.
REST API Integration: The model is accessible via a REST API, making it easy to integrate into various applications and services.
Scalable and Efficient: The implementation ensures efficient handling of requests, allowing for scalable usage.
How It Works
User Input: The user provides a textual prompt describing the desired image.
API Request: The application sends the prompt to the REST API endpoint.
Image Generation: The Stable Diffusion 2.1 model processes the prompt and generates an image.
Response: The generated image is returned to the user.
